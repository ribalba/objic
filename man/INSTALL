This is the install document for the objic language. 

1) First of all you have to check if you have python > 2.4 installed, this can be best done by running :

$ python -V

This has to return something bigger than Python 2.4.0

Then you have to check for the antlr python libraries. 

$ python -c 'import antlr3' 

If either of these command fail you have to install these packages. Most distributions will supply packages consult man apt-get or man yum for more information. Otherwise 

http://www.python.org/ 
http://www.antlr.org/

will help

2) After checking for the libs you can extract the code and install it

the source code can be found under objic.ribalba.de

after downloading the latest version 

$ tar -xvzf objic.tar.gz

will unzip the file with all you need.


3) It is advised to edit the configuration file. This should be relative self explanatory and the default settings are normally OK for testing

4) Then you have to setup your execution path to include the executable files This is done by extending your PATH to include the src folder

$ export PATH=/path/to/source:$PATH

will normally do the trick
